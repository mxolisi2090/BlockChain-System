# BlockChain-System

This system is used to check how old a second hand car is before you buy is.
With this system the Manufacture like Toyota will register the car engin code and other details about the car on the system 
so when the client is about to buy a car he/she will logon into the system then write the engine code on the system then the system will retrieve all
the information about the car.
*I used blockchain because you can only see the information in the system you can't modify it so the information in the system it true and valid.
I have used:
* Java
